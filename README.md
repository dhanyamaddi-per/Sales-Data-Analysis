# 📊 Sales Data Analysis - STAT515 Final Project

This repository contains the final project submission for Group 16 of STAT515 at George Mason University. The project centers around a comprehensive analysis of a sales dataset to uncover meaningful patterns, trends, and predictive insights using statistical and machine learning methods.

## 📁 Project Files
- `sales_data_sample-1.csv`: The raw dataset sourced from Kaggle.
- `sales_data_code.R`: The final project report detailing our methodology, analysis, visualizations, and conclusions.

## 📌 Project Objectives
- Perform **data cleaning** to prepare the dataset for analysis.
- Conduct **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand key sales patterns and customer behaviors.
- Build **statistical and machine learning models** to predict sales and deal size.
- Apply **data visualization** techniques to communicate findings clearly and effectively.

## 🧪 Techniques Used
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Histograms, boxplots, bar charts.
- **Linear Regression**: To analyze the relationship between quantity ordered and total sales.
- **Multiple Regression**: To predict sales using multiple features like MSRP and price.
- **Lasso & Ridge Regression**: For feature selection and regularization.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: For dimensionality reduction and data structure understanding.
- **K-Means Clustering**: To group similar sales transactions.
- **Random Forest**: To evaluate feature importance and predict deal size.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Highlights
- Identified and handled missing values and outliers.
- Standardized formats for consistent data representation.
- Ensured correct data types and column formatting for accurate analysis.

## 📈 Key Findings
- **Classic Cars** had the highest sales, especially in **November**.
- **USA** recorded the most large-scale deals.
- Sales are **positively correlated** with quantity ordered.
- Features like **SALES**, **PRICEEACH**, and **MSRP** were most influential in predicting deal size.
